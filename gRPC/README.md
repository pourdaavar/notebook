## Interoduction
gRPC can use protocol buffers as both its Interface Definition Language (IDL) and as its underlying message interchage format.

## Overview
in gRPC, a client app can directly call a method on a server app on different machine as if it were a local project. making it easier for you to create distributed applications and services.
As in many RPC systems, gRPC is based around the idea of defining a service, specifying the methods that can be called remotely with their parameters and return types.
