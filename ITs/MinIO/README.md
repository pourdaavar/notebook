# MinIo

### What's an Object
An 'Object' is a Binary Large Object - BLOB
- Documents, Photos, Videos
- BLOBs can have any size, format, structure or even type

### What is a bucket?
A collection of related objects, policies, and configurations

- Think of a Bucket like a Volume
- Amazon limits buckets to ~100/account, where each bucket has a golbally unique DNS
- MinIo does not have bucket limites - but you should still think of buckets like volumes
